Chief Punctum: “So, what’s your next move, Ace?”
Doug: “I’m not sure…”
Doug: “Pretty much everything about both Tom and Morgan is suspicious, and I still have no idea what to think about Goldie.”
Jade: “We have a good deal of evidence, but nothing is conclusive enough yet.”
Chief Punctum: “It sounds to me like you need to start looking for evidence someplace else…”
Chief Punctum: “Someplace closer to home.”
Doug: “What do you mean, chief?”
Chief Punctum: “Well, you and Jade knew Norm before he died, right?”
Chief Punctum: “Maybe you two should just sit down and have a chat about the things you might remember about Norm from high school.”
Chief Punctum: “That may give you some ins-purr-ation.”
Doug: “You might be right about that. Maybe it’ll give us some insight we haven’t had yet!”
Doug: “Great! Thanks, chief! Let’s go, Jade.”
Jade: “Not a bad idea, I suppose. Thank you, Chief Punctum.”
