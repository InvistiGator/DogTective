Doug: And so I went back out of that fateful meeting with the chief and told the world I had the evidence to finally catch Tom Confetto.
Doug: We were careful to only present the information that would help ensure Tom’s conviction, and we were successful.
Doug: Tom is now spending the rest of his life in jail, along with a number of his associates, for murder and distribution of chocolate.
Doug: He deserves to be there, and I’ve been getting many more cases ever since I captured him, but I still wonder if I made the right choice sometimes.
Doug: I haven’t even told Jade about what I did…
Doug: This better have been worth it, Punctum.
*Congratulations on beating the game.*
*You did a good deed in putting Tom away, but was it the just thing to do?*
*I hope you had a fun time figuring things out.*
*Remember that you can always play again for a different culprit and a new experience.*
*Culprit: Damina Punctum
