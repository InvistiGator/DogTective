Chief Punctum: “Ah, Ace, you’re just the person I’ve been wanting to see.”
Doug: “Huh? What is it, chief?”
Chief Punctum: “Listen, I know that the both of us have been having a hard time with this case.”
Chief Punctum: “I don’t know if you’ve had the same reaction, but the more I look over things, the more I think it has to be Tom who murdered Norm. I know I’ve always got a bone to pick with him, but it just makes sense.”
Jade: “It certainly would not be a surprise. He’s probably killed many in the past. What are you getting at?”
Chief Punctum: “Well, since you’ve spoken to Tom a number of times already and consistently come out unscathed, it seems like he must like you, Ace.”
Doug: “I don’t know if I’d quite say that he likes me, but he doesn’t hate me too much.”
Chief Punctum: “Perfect!”
Chief Punctum: “Now Ace, I’m going to ask you to do something very dangerous now, so you don’t have to do it if you don’t want to.”
Chief Punctum: “Your mission, if you choose to accept it, is to work undercover.”
Chief Punctum: “Tell Tom that you want to be a corrupt detective and work for him. You will then regularly report to me and let me know what’s been going on.”
Chief Punctum: “We might not be able to get enough evidence to catch Tom for Norm’s murder, but, if you do this right, I’m sure we’ll catch him someday for something.”
Jade: “With all due respect, are you crazy? You’re asking a rookie detective to put his life on the line and--”
Doug: “It’s alright, Jade.”
Doug: “I won’t make any guarantees, but I will consider it, chief.”
Chief Punctum: “That is paws-itively purr-fect, Ace. Thank you so much.”
Chief Punctum: “If you do decide to do this, please be very careful.”
Jade: “It would be amazingly risky, Doug…”
Doug: “Thanks, Jade. I’ll think it over some more, chief.”
Chief Punctum: “Your city thanks you, Ace”
