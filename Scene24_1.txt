Jade: “It’s amazing that someone could be selling the most unhealthy and addictive drug known to animalkind from a sleazy pub.”
Doug: “It’ll become slightly less amazing once you speak with Tom more, trust me.”
Doug: “That hound may be sleazy, but he’s a really sweet talker. I can’t even begin to imagine how many people he’s gotten to consume his confectionary narcotic.”
Jade: “That’s what I’ve heard… Well, this ought to be interesting.”
Doug: “Hey, Tom, how are you doing?”
Tom: “We-heh-ell if it isn’t my old friend Doug.”
Tom: “And you’ve brought your friend with you too. How nice.”
Jade: “The name’s Jade. It’s a… unique pleasure to have made your acquaintance.”
Tom: “You certainly got a polite friend there.”
Tom: “So, what seems to be troubling you now, Doug?”
