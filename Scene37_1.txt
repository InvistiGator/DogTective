Setting: Doug’s Office
Doug: “I remember some things! Let’s talk about my memories of Norm.”
Doug: “Since you were off taking all of the craziest higher level stuff that you could, I probably took more classes with him.”
Jade: “That’s actually quite a valid point, Doug.”
Jade: “Please, do go on.”
Doug: “...”
Doug: “...”
Jade: “You don’t remember anything do you?”
Doug: “Just give me a second, okay? I’m thinking about it.”
*Several minutes pass…*
Doug: “Hm…”
Doug: “Oh, yeah! I remember now.”
Doug: “There was one summer that I had to take a few classes in order to catch up, and I remember Doug being in them.”
Doug: “He even baked cookies for the whole class once!”
Jade: “Does anything other than your stomach have any memories of that time?”
Doug: “Ha, ha. That was just an example, Jade.”
Doug: “He was always a very nice guy, but I don’t think he ever got any attention for it.”
Doug: “Since he was failing even those summer classes, our teacher would constantly scold him.”
Doug: “Possibly because of that, none of the other kids really became friends with him.”
Doug: “He wasn’t actively bullied, but maybe the other kids ignoring him because he was ‘the stupid one’ was just as bad.”
Doug: “My head was almost always stuck in a Sherlock Holmes book at the time, so I didn’t see all that much, but, thinking back, I feel sorry for the guy.”
Doug: “It seems like no one would be sad to see him gone…”
Doug: “And now we’re only talking about him because something happened to him.”
Jade: “It is quite saddening, now that you mention it, but we have to focus on solving this case for his sake.”
Doug: “Yeah!”
Jade: “I’m somewhat impressed, though. You actually did remember some important things about him.”
Jade: “Maybe you’ve accidentally been doing detective work your whole life without realizing it.”
Doug: “I definitely realized it! I’ve always been alert as to what’s going on around me.”
Doug: Maybe… Probably…
