Doug: “Let’s stay out here and hear everything that Goldie might have to say.”
Jade: “A reasonable plan. She might divulge something that she does not mean to.”
Jade: “I’ll be recording everything we hear from now on in case we need it as evidence.”
Doug: “Thanks, Jade.”
Jade: “...”
Doug: “...”
Goldie: “Ugh, I just couldn’t stand that mean Norm ignoring me even the slightest bit after I had given him everything he could ever want.”
Goldie: “I didn’t realize I would kill him, but it’s fine that I did, he was getting to be boring.”
Goldie: “Stabbing that pen at him was supposed to send a message, but I guess I ended up sending him the last one of his life.”
Goldie: “Whoops.”
Doug: “...”
Jade: “...”
Doug: “I think that’s enough, Jade. Let’s take that recording into the police and put our first murderer behind bars.”
Jade: “With pleasure.”
