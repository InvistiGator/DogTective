Setting: The Police Station
Doug: “Chief! Chief! Something really weird is going on at the scene of the crime!”
Chief Punctum: “Woah, slow down a little, Ace.”
Doug: “Okay, so, we’ve been investigating Morgan and Goldie lately, and things have been getting more and more suspicious.”
Jade: “When we went to Norm’s house just now, we could see that Goldie was inside and that the body had disappeared.”
Doug: “I have no clue why or how they were able to do it, but something’s definitely wrong.”
Chief Punctum: “I agree, Ace. It seems pretty reasonable to assume that the fine folks over at KT Corp had something to do with Norm’s murder.”
Chief Punctum: “I’ll send some good officers over to the scene now to apprehend whoever is there, but before I do, I’ve got one more thing to ask you.”
Chief Punctum: “Who do you believe is responsible for the murder of Norm Previse?”
