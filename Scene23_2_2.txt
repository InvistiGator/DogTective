Doug: “We’ll go find ourselves some REAL evidence without any help from the likes of you.”
Morgan: “My goodness, Mr. Ventose, what is wrong with you?”
Morgan: “You invade my office, badger me for information, and then utterly refuse it when I give it to you.”
Morgan: “Get out of here this instant you *bark* runt!”
*You leave the building.*
Jade: “So I agree that the evidence was probably fake, but I’m amazed how mad you were able to make Morgan back there.”
Doug: “Me too. I hope it was for the best.”
