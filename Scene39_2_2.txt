Jade: “Huh, that’s odd.”
Doug: “What? What is it?”
Jade: “Norm’s file isn’t here…”
Jade: “Well, his name is technically here, but his entire file is just empty. It looks like someone wiped it completely.”
Doug: “Huh… it must have taken someone with a lot of computer know-how to hack in there and whatnot.”
Doug: “You’re really into computer stuff, Jade. Do you know of anyone who could have done that?”
Jade: “Uh… I can’t say that I do.”
Jade: “Besides, we have no way of knowing when this was wiped, so it could have nothing to do with the murder.”
Doug: “Maybe, but this is a good piece of evidence to have nonetheless.”
Doug: “Let’s not get too discouraged as we move on.”
Jade: “Yes, you’re right.”
