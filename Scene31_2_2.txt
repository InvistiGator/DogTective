Doug: “And Goldie didn’t help. She always got whatever she wanted from both Norm and Morgan.”
Doug: “I’m not entirely certain that she was directly responsible for Norm’s murder, but she is definitely to blame for creating this toxic situation.”

Doug: “I really hope they are at the crime scene. Time to give these pompous individuals what’s coming to them.”
