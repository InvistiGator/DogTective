Doug: “If you think I’m leaving before finding out more about how he might have been killed than you are more crazy than this ridiculous mansion.”

Doug: “And all the money in the world won’t be able to get you out of it.”
Doug: Wow! I am awesome at this whole standing up for myself thing!
Goldie: “Ugh… bla  bla bla… Stop acting like you’re a big scary dog.”
Goldie: “Listen, if it’ll get you to go away, I’ll tell you who you should be talking to.”
Goldie: “Morgan Evetta. He’s my lawyer. He’ll know about whatever it is you’re going on about.”
Doug: “You see? Was that so hard?”
Doug: “I was hoping you could tell me a bit more, but that’s a start. I may be back later, so be ready for more questions.”
Goldie: “Whatever…”

Doug: I believe he was Norm’s actual boss, so I’m sure he’ll know something about all this.
