Doug: Let’s see... The owner of KT Corp is Goldie Weal, and she lives…
Doug: ...here?!
Doug: *Woof*, that’s a big mansion! She must have all of the cat-viar a cat could want!
Doug: Come on, Doug, you can’t let her wealth and power get to you. I’m sure she’s just a normal animal and talking to her will go juuust fine.
[Audio: Knocking on door]
*knock* *knock*
???: “*MEOW*!”
Doug: Huh?? Did I do something wrong already? Isn’t knocking on doors a normal thing to do?! 
*The front door flies open*
Goldie: “Who DARES interrupt my twice-daily nap time?!”
Goldie: “My beauty sleep is more precious than whatever stupid problem you’re having!”
Doug: Her… beauty sleep? I thought she was a business mogul… 
Goldie: “What sort of stupid stupid… uh… stupid person would bother me at a time like this?!”
Doug: No, you’re stupid...
Doug: “Excuse me, Ms. Weal, I am investigating--”
Goldie: “Ugh… a cop or whatever? This isn’t worth my time. I could be sleeping or rolling in pounds of catnip worth more than everything you own in the world!”
Goldie: “I don’t care what happened to whoever it is. It’s not my problem, and I would like to get back to my lovely naptime.”
Doug: “It’ll only take a moment to--”
Goldie: “I don’t care you stupid... mutt! Now leave me at once!”
