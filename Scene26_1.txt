Setting: The Police Station
Chief Punctum: “Well, Ace… I can see that you’ve been doing a terrific job of not making enemies.”
Doug: “This wasn’t my fault, chief!”
Doug: “We went over to Goldie’s to ask her more about the murder, but, when I brought up Norm’s name, she just started crying.”
Doug: “Then Morgan and some of his goons showed up, said we were trespassing, and brought us here.”
Jade: “Doug is absolutely correct, chief. I doubt we could have seen this coming.”
Chief Punctum: “Listen, I really don’t like these KT Corp people either, but you have to be really careful.”
Chief Punctum: “Luckily for you two, Morgan doesn’t have any evidence to convict you of wrongdoing, but if you annoy him enough, he will make you pay. 
Chief Punctum: “Or worse - you’ll never get any information out of him, not that he’s been very helpful thus far.”
Chief Punctum: “And with that, you’re free to go. Now that you are, please be more careful with your actions in the future.”
Doug: “Thanks, chief.”
Jade: “Yes. Thank you very much.”
Chief Punctum: “So, what’s your next move, Ace?”
Doug: “I’m not sure…”
Doug: “Pretty much everything about both Tom and Morgan is suspicious, and I still have no idea what to think about Goldie.”
Jade: “We have a good deal of evidence, but nothing is conclusive enough yet.”
Chief Punctum: “It sounds to me like you need to start looking for evidence someplace else…”
Chief Punctum: “Someplace closer to home.”
Doug: “What do you mean, chief?”
Chief Punctum: “Well, you and Jade knew Norm before he died, right?”
Chief Punctum: “Maybe you two should just sit down and have a chat about the things you might remember about Norm from high school.”
Chief Punctum: “That may give you some ins-purr-ation.”
Doug: “You might be right about that. Maybe it’ll give us some insight we haven’t had yet!”
Doug: “Great! Thanks, chief! Let’s go, Jade.”
Jade: “Not a bad idea, I suppose. Thank you, Chief Punctum.”
