Doug: “We have to learn more about Tom, but there’s no way I’d ever put you in any danger. I’m the risk-taking detective here, after all.”
Jade: “I really don’t think that’s a good idea, Doug. You could get into some serious trouble… or worse…”
Doug: “I’ll be fine, Jade. I’m a professional detective, remember?”
Jade: “*sigh* Alright… Call me when you’re done with your shenanigans.”
*Jade leaves*
Doug: “Let me see… where should the snooping begin…”
Doug: I got it!
Doug: I’m sure that this place must have a back door where all of the shady dealings take place. I should go there and eavesdrop on these villains.
Doug: I’ll just walk right into this alleyway next to the saloon…
Doug: ... and crouch down behind this dumpster; ready to sprint away at a moment’s notice.
Doug: …
Doug: …
Doug: … … … 
Doug: “Wow this is taking SOOOO long!”
Tom: “Huh? Who said that?!”
*The back door flies open*
Tom: “Who *bark* dares come onto my property unwelcome??!!”
Tom: “Oh I see you there. Don’t you dare try to hide!”
Doug: “No, uh, hey, Tom, this isn’t--”
Tom: “You poor little *bark* runt… It doesn’t matter what it is.”
Tom: “Nobody sneaks on me and gets away with it!”
*Our detective friend is no more…”
*Please restart this scene.*
*Oh, and do a better job at staying alive next time.*
