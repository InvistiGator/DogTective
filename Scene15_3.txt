Jade: “There was also a patchy trail of red ink leading to the exit near The Sultry Saloon.”
Jade: “I had thought that the red ink implied the murderer knew Norm from his place of work, but perhaps it was just--”

Jade: “Things aren't looking very good for Tom, are they?”
Doug: “I’m not so sure about that, Jade…”

Doug: “It smelled like…”
Doug: “...cleaning supplies.”
Jade: “Hm… I did notice an odd smell around there.”
Doug: “So I'm thinking that there must have been something there as well that was recently cleaned up. Maybe even another trail of red ink.”
Jade: “It’s impossible to know for sure, unfortunately.”
Jade: “There is something we can know with more certainty, however.”
Jade: “I noticed that both exits appeared to be slightly worn. They’ve likely both been used recently.”
