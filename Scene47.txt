Doug: So I let Jade get away with it, and how couldn’t I?
Doug: They are my best friend, and they might have done something really wrong, but it was an accident.
Doug: Can you really let someone be punished so much for something they didn’t mean to do?
Doug: I don’t know the answer to that question, but with Jade… I just couldn’t let that happen.
Doug: They and I help each other out with feelings of grief over all of this, but it can only help so much.
Doug: I hope they never catch them. Not after all we’ve been through.
Doug: After all of that, Jade and I have to make it through things.
Doug: No matter what, though, we will always be best friends.

*Remember that you can always play again for a different culprit and a new experience.*
