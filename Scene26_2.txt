Chief Punctum: “Well, Ace… I can see that you’ve been doing a terrific job of not making enemies.”
Doug: “This wasn’t my fault, chief!”
Doug: “We went over to Goldie’s to ask her more about the murder, but, when I brought up Norm’s name, she just started crying.”
Doug: “Then Morgan and some of his goons showed up, said we were trespassing, and brought us here.”
Jade: “Doug is absolutely correct, chief. I doubt we could have seen this coming.”
Chief Punctum: “Listen, I really don’t like these KT Corp people either, but you have to be really careful.”
Chief Punctum: “Luckily for you two, Morgan doesn’t have any evidence to convict you of wrongdoing, but if you annoy him enough, he will make you pay. 
Chief Punctum: “Or worse - you’ll never get any information out of him, not that he’s been very helpful thus far.”
Chief Punctum: “And with that, you’re free to go. Now that you are, please be more careful with your actions in the future.”
Doug: “Thanks, chief.”
Jade: “Yes. Thank you very much.”
