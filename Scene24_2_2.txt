Doug: “So… Tom… I found this tie near where Norm died…”
Tom: “Yes…?”
Doug: “Oh, uh… I know it isn’t yours. Your ties look so much nicer.”
Doug: “But I was wondering if you happened to have any friends with similar tastes in ties?”
Doug: “Maybe they’d know more about what happened to Norm?”
Tom: “Well that’s an awfully strange question you’re asking me, buddy.”
Tom: “I’ve got many different types of ties that I wear, and I know a many people who wear many of the same ties too.”
Tom: “So I’m sorry to say that I don’t know anything about that tie or who might have worn it.”
Jade: “Yes, that makes perfect sense, Mr. Confetto.”
Tom: “Please, call me Tom.”
Doug: “Alrighty! I think that’s about it. Thanks again for your time.”
Tom: “No problem, buddy.”
*You leave the saloon.*
Jade: “So, do you think that tie was just a piece of fake evidence that Morgan made?”
Doug: “We can’t know for sure, but I think so.”
Doug: “If it actually was Tom’s, he might have had us killed in there.”
Jade: “Please don’t tell me you just gambled with our lives like that…”
Doug: “Nah, I was totally in control the whole time.”
Doug: Totally…
