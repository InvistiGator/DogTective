Location: Goldie’s Mansion
Jade: “You spoke to Goldie earlier, right Doug?”
Doug: “Yeah, why?”
Jade: “You must have been surprised at how little she seems like a business mogul.”
Doug: “Yeah. She’s just a spoiled brat who probably has everyone else do everything for her.”
Doug: “Listen, Jade, if you become rich and famous someday for being a genius rocket heart scientist surgeon, don’t let it go to your head.”

Goldie: “You. Fox.”
Goldie: “My password to log onto that site is catnip37.”
Goldie: “You should be able to access whatever the *meow* you want. And I’ll make Morgan change the password when I wake up.”
Goldie: “Now, I’m going to lay down in my lovely bed and forget about you two waking me up.”
*She slams the door shut.*
Jade: “Well she is just lovely.”
Doug: “Isn’t she?”
Doug: “Anyway, let’s see what we can find in those records.”
