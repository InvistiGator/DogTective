Jade: “While we’re here, though, I was thinking we could do a little more talking about Norm.”
Doug: “About Norm?”
Doug: “Shouldn't we be asking people who might actually be the culprit about him?”
Jade: “Not necessarily.”
Jade: “We should be taking the time to learn more about Norm, so that we can better understand what might have led to him getting killed.”
Doug: “Well, we know that he became addicted to chocolate at some point, and that he somehow got a well-paying job at a law firm.”
Jade: “All of those things are true, but I meant that we should be learning more about Norm himself, like what kind of person he was.”
Jade: “We knew him from high school and all, so we should think back and see if we can remember things about his character.”
Jade: “You somehow forgot about him entirely, though, so this may be all up to me.”
Doug: “Hey! I’ve started to remember a few things about him.”
Jade: “Riiiiight.”
Jade: “Anyway, what would you like to talk about regarding Norm?”
