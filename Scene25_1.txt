Setting: Goldie’s Mansion
Jade: “You spoke to Goldie earlier, right Doug?”
Doug: “Yeah, why?”
Jade: “You must have been surprised at how little she seems like a business mogul.”
Doug: “Yeah. She’s just a spoiled brat who probably has everyone else do everything for her.”
Doug: “Listen, Jade, if you become rich and famous someday for being a genius rocket heart scientist surgeon, don’t let it go to your head.”
Jade: “Ha ha, you should have more faith in me than that.”
Jade: “I’ll try my best not to let things get to my head while performing surgery on the heart of a rocket.”
Doug: “You better not.”
*You knock on Goldie’s door.*
Goldie: “*MEOW*”
Doug: “Not again…”
Jade: “Wait, what? Again??”
*The door flies open.*
Goldie: “I was finally settling into a comfortable nap when--”
Goldie: “Not you again!”
Doug: “Yes, me again. I brought a friend, too.”
Jade: “I’m Jade. You look… lovely today, Ms. Weal.”
Goldie: “Ugh…”
Goldie: “Uggggghhhhh…”
*Her annoyance slowly turns into a low, rumbling growl.*
Goldie: “Why won’t you just let me get my beauty sleep?!”
Doug: “Norm Previse is dead, and we must find out who killed him.”
Doug: “So if you know absolutely anything about what happened to him, you have to tell us right now!”
Goldie: “Norm… Norm is… dead?”
Jade: “Um… Are you al--”
Goldie: “Waaahhhh!!”
*Goldie starts crying… profusely.*
*Goldie slams the door shut in front of you.*
Jade: “Well, that was quite the surprise.”
Doug: “I guess we can assume that they knew each other.”
Doug: “She seems very distraught about his murder… I don’t know if she could have killed him, but she may have more to tell us.”
Jade: “Once she stops crying, that is.”
Jade: “Let’s come back later.”
