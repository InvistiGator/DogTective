Setting: Doug’s Office
Doug: “I just can’t get over how there isn’t any body.”
Doug: “Not only that, we haven’t found any conclusive evidence proving that someone has committed a murder even though everyone is very suspicious.”
Jade: “Perhaps we should begin checking places that Norm might have run away to…”
*The door bursts open.*
*A cat stands at the door. Their head is down, and they are panting heavily.*
*They lift their face slowly…*
???: “*pant*... *pant*...”
Norm: “Long time no see, friends!”
Doug: “Norm?!”
Jade: “Is that really you?”
Norm: “Aw, you two don’t recognize an old friend?”
Doug: “Well--”
Jade: “We thought you might be dead.”
Norm: “Oh, right! That whole faking my death thing. I almost forgot about that.”
Norm: “I had no idea how well that would go.”
Jade: “Norm… We were worried about you!”
Jade: “Why in the world did you fake your death?” 
Doug: “And why are you telling us about it?”
Norm: “Well, I finally realized how bad my chocolate addiction was, and how messed up things were at my job, so I decided to fake my death.”
Doug: “I don’t think that faking one’s death is the obvious choice…”
Norm: “It was just what came to mind first! It works really well, doesn’t it?”
Jade: “You could say that…”
Norm: “Anyway, I’m glad that I was able to find you two! I need to ask you for a really big favor.”
Norm: “Jade, you’ve always been really smart.”
Norm: “And Doug, I know you just became a cool detective.”
Norm: “You guys should help me murder someone!”
Doug: “...”
Jade: “...”
Jade: “Come again?”
Norm: “Oh, I should say who it is and everything, right?”
Norm: “You two should help me murder Tom.”
Doug: “...”
Jade: “...”
Doug: “Seriously…?”
Norm: “Yeah! Even I can tell that he is a very bad dog…”
Jade: “I can’t disagree that the world would be a better place without that Confetto, but I don’t know if murder is the answer.”
Norm: “His drugs really hurt me a lot and I know it’s been the same with a lot of others like me.”
Norm: “He’s killed a lot of people…”
Doug: “What a strange turn of events…”
Norm: “Please, you two? I really can’t do this on my own…”
