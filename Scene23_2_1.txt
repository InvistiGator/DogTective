Morgan: “There we are, Mr. Ventose. No need for such standoffish behavior.”
Doug: “Yeah, whatever. Thanks for your time, Fancy Pants.”
Jade: “How kind of you to give him thanks, Doug. I cannot say the same.”
Jade: “Farewell, Mr. Evetta.”

Jade: “In any case, remember to take anything he says or gives us with an appropriate grain of salt. That evidence might be fabricated.”
Doug: “I’ll be careful, Jade.”
Doug: “You never know what evidence might be useful in the future.”
