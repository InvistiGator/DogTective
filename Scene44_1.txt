Setting: Doug’s Office
Doug: Oh, Jade… You haven’t figured it out yet, have you?
Doug: Should I tell you? Should I stay silent?
Doug: You are my best friend and I do so want to tell you, but I don’t know if I should.
Doug: If everything goes well, then you’ll never have to know.
Doug: If things go south, you may hate me forever.
*You look down at your paws and think for several moments about your situation.*
Doug: I killed Norm.
Doug: And now, do I want to burden someone else with that knowledge?
