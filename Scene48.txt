Doug: Jade is a genius and a great person, but one mistake has ended up ruining their life.
Doug: Even though they didn’t kill Norm intentionally, they still had to pay for their actions.
Doug: They forgave me for making them turn themselves in, but I didn’t feel good about it, and things haven’t be the same ever since.
Doug: At first, I went and visited them all the time to provide support and let them know that things would be okay, but… things weren’t okay for our friendship.
Doug: I visited them less and less as time went by as I became more busy with all of my cases, and they didn’t complain.
Doug: They’ve become so reserved lately… 
Doug: I’m sorry, Jade. I’m so sorry.
Doug: But this was for the best.
