Doug: I don’t know if I have enough evidence to bring him in…
Doug: I guess I’ll have to do what the chief said.
Doug: “Please leave now, Jade. You know what I came here to do.”
Jade: “Doug…”
Doug: “I said now. Just get outta here already.”
Jade: “If you’re sure that’s what you want…”
*Jade leaves.*
Doug: “Now, where were we, Tom?”
Doug: “Oh, that’s right, I was about to give you a great offer.”
Tom: “An offer is it? What could ya possibly want to offer me?”
Doug: “Why… my services of course.”
Tom: “What was that?”
Doug: “You see, Tom… I became a detective to do something exciting; something most people only ever dream of doing…”
Doug: “But so far, things have been incredibly boring.”
Doug: “I barely ever get a case, and, even then, most of them are easy, boring, or petty.”
Doug: “So today, I come here to offer you my services.”
Doug: “I’m a fresh young detective with little history, but I’ve also become close friends with Chief Punctum.”
Doug: “I’m just the sort of person who could work to get you all of the information you could want, and even do you some favors from time to time.”
Doug: “As long as I’m properly compensated for my efforts, that is.”
Tom: “Well whaddya know… I didn’t take you for this type of person, Doug. You’re a tricky one.” 
Tom: “But you aren’t wrong. My… establishment could certainly use someone like you.” 
Tom: “Come, let’s talk business…”
Doug: And so begins my time as an undercover agent.
Doug: I won’t let you down, chief.
