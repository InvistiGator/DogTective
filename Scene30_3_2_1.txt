Goldie: “And so I--”
Doug: “Hold it right there, Goldie!”
Goldie: “Well if it isn’t you idiots again. Why are you bothering me this time?”
Jade: “In case you’ve not yet noticed, you’re standing in the middle of a crime scene which we are supposed to be investigating.”
Doug: “And they say the culprit always returns to the scene of the crime.”
Goldie: “Well I don’t care what they say because I can do whatever the *meow* I want.”
Goldie: “Even I can tell that you don’t have enough evidence on who killed Norm.”
Doug: “Wait, are you admitting to the murder?”
Goldie: “Are you stupid? I’m not admitting to anything. Have fun continuing your little investigation.”
