Setting: The Sultry Saloon (still…)
*Time passes.*
*LOTS of time passes.*
Doug: “Ugh, Jade, this is SO--”
Jade: “Shh!”
Doug: “...boring.”
Jade: “I warned you, Doug, we have to stay quiet. We can’t let them know we’re here.” 
Jade: “I can hear people walking around behind that back door pretty often, so someone could come out at any moment.”
Doug: “Really? I can barely hear anything.”
Doug: “Oh! Wait, now I can--”
Jade: “Shh!”
*Tom walks out of the door while talking on the phone.*
Tom: “--get me some fresh air.”
Tom: “Now listen, Mikey, I’m tired’a you callin’ me all the time because you can’t remember a single thing I say.”
Tom: “I say to go sell on a certain street, and you forget which *bark* street.”
Tom: “I say to meet me at the saloon, and you forget what *bark* time.”
Tom: “I tell you the password to open up one o’ my secret passages, and you forget how it goes.”
Doug: Secret passages?! Awesome!
Tom: “It’s two knocks then a pause… one knock then a pause… and then three knocks.”
Tom: “Is that really so hard for you to remember? Two, one, three. Got it?”
*Tom hangs up.*
Tom: “Geez, the *bark* I have do deal with…”
*Tom goes back into the saloon.*
Doug: “A SECRE--”
Jade: “Shh!” 
Doug: “A secret passage! That’s awesome!”
Jade: “It is pretty amazing to imagine that Tom has secret passages somewhere in town.”
Doug: “Two, one, three. Got it. Let me just… start… trying it…”
Jade: “What are you--”
*You perform the two-one-three knock in as many different places in the alley as you can.*
*The dumpster, the wall, on Jade’s shoulder…*
Doug: “Aw… nothing…”
Jade: “Really, Doug…?”
Doug: “Just one last time, okay?”
*You knock on the ground in front of you and Jade.*
*...*
*click*
Doug: “Huh?”
*A hatch in the ground slowly rises open.*
Doug: “Woooaaahhh…” 
Jade: “Woah indeed…”
Doug: “Hey, let’s go!” 
Jade: “Huh?”
*You pull Jade’s hand and enter the hatch.*
