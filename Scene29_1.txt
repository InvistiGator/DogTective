Setting: Goldie’s Mansion
Doug: “Okay, I really hope she doesn’t react so badly this time.”
Jade: “Goldie is a very… unusual individual, isn’t she?”
Doug: “You got that right. Let’s see how she is now.”
*knock knock*
Goldie: “Waaaaaaahhh!”
Doug: “Huh? Now what is it?”
*The door opens slowly.*
Goldie: “*sob* *sniff* What are you doing here, you stupid detective? Can’t you see that I am busy with my grieving?”
Jade: “I’m pretty sure everyone in the neighborhood is aware of your grieving by now.”
Doug: “Well, about Norm--”
Goldie: “*sob* *sob* Stop talking about him like that. *sniff*”
Doug: What? I didn’t even say anything!
Jade: “We are sorry for having bothered you with this, ma’am, but we really must know if you have any information on the murder.”
Goldie: “*sniff* No, no, this is all so terrible…”
Goldie: “Norm was one of the only people who was ever really nice to me…”
Doug: Huh, maybe Goldie is a nice person after all.
Goldie: “Most people are intimidated by how awesome *sniff* and cool and rich I am, but Norm was different.”
Doug: Aaaand nope. I knew she couldn’t actually be that nice.
