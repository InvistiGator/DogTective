Doug: “It’s time to have start having some fun with this investigation!”
Jade: “Wha…”
*You crack your knuckles…*
*And start knocking on any surface you can find in a two-one-three pattern.*

*Nothing is spared from your knuckled wrath.*

Doug: “And voilà!”
*A section of the wall parts open and becomes a doorway.*
Jade: “Wow… I'm not sure whether I should be impressed or if you are just the luckiest dog who’s ever lived.”
Doug: “You dare question my skills, young one?”
Doug: “I am the secret passage master!”
Doug: “The Master Commander of Secret Passages!”
Jade: “Yes, yes, master commander. Have you had enough fun with all this yet?”
Doug: “Aw, come on. You know that fit the moment.”
Doug: “And yes, I am ‘done’ for now. I’m even more excited to get to exploring the place.”
Jade: “Then let us investigate.”
Setting: A Secret Passage
Doug: “Wow! It’s amazing that Norm had a secret passage in his own home.”
Doug: “I can only imagine how many secret passages Tom might have all over town.”
Jade: “Indeed. Tom must be amazingly wealthy and powerful in order to pull something like this off.”
Doug: “This place is pretty barren, though. I hope we’ll be able to find some sort of evidence.”
Jade: “This passage is quite large as well. We should see where it leads…”
Doug: “Onwards!”
*You and Jade explore the passage for some time.*
Doug: “Okay, let’s go over what we’ve learned about this secret passage.”
Jade: “Right.”
Jade: “This passage leads to two different places: near the police station and near The Sultry Saloon.”
