Doug: “This tie was found near the scene of the crime!”
Doug: “It is stained completely red, and it’s the type of tie that you are usually seen wearing.”
Doug: “This will be the evidence that puts you behind bars, Tom!”
Doug: I think…?
Tom: “Now, Doug. There’s something you should know…”
Tom: “Nobody ever comes into my establishment and tells me *bark* stuff like that!”
Tom: “And you wanna know what happens to the mutts who do that?!”
Doug: “Not particularly, no…”
Tom: “That’s too bad.”
Tom: “Sic ‘em, fellas.”
*Tom kills you and Jade. It’s not pretty.*
*Wow, you were really confident about that tie Morgan gave you.*
*Did you read his bio? It mentions how he fabricates evidence.*
*Fortunately, this is a video game, so you can get back into things with the newfound knowledge that shoving a tie into Tom’s face is a bad idea.*
*It’s good to learn from your mistakes.*
