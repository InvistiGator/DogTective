Doug: “I know that you have more information about Norm than you’ve been letting on.”
Doug: “So tell us everything you know, or things won’t be pretty!”
Tom: “Ha ha…” 
Tom: “Ha ha ha ha ha!”
Jade: “Uh… Doug? I think you might have wanted to phrase that differently…” 
Tom: “Oh, man, you two just crack me up all the time.” 
Tom: “I tell you to leave me the *bark* alone…” 
Tom: “But you just don’t GET it, do ya??!!”
Doug: “Well… er… um… Sorry?”
Tom: “Sorry’s not gonna cut it this time, buddy.” 
Tom: “Sic ‘em, boys…”
*Wow, you managed to get both you and Jade killed.*
*Pretty gruesome deaths too, as far as I can imagine.*
*Oh, and nobody ever finds out who killed Norm, by the way.*
*So how about you get back in there, make different life choices, and find the murderer, okay?*
*Do it for Norm.*
*Do it for Jade.*
*Do it for the Master Commander of Secret Passages.*
*I, for one, totally believe in you.*
