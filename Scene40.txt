Setting: The Police Station
Doug: “Well, we’ve accumulated quite a bit of information about Norm, but it still isn’t really pointing us anywhere.”
Doug: “We should talk to the chief and see if she can help us out with anything.”
Jade: “Sure. Perhaps she’ll be able to make something of all this.”
Chief Punctum: “Well hello there, Ace. How are you? You look like you made a beeline to this feline, so I’m thinking you’ve got something you want to talk about.”
Doug: “Yeah, chief.”
Doug: “We’ve thought back on our past experiences with Norm and have collected a good deal of information on him, but it still isn’t really pointing us anywhere.”
Doug: “Do you have a any advice for us on that chief?”
Chief Punctum: “Well, as far as I can tell, there are two different things you can do when you’ve gotten to this point in an investigation.”
Doug: “And what are they?”
Chief Punctum: “First, make sure you have spoken to everyone you want to talk to. There could always be some more important information that you just haven’t found out yet.”
Chief Punctum: “Second, once think you have everything you need, head back to base and regroup. There may be information that is just staring you in the face that you haven’t noticed yet.”
Doug: “That all sounds like perfect stuff for a detective dog like me to be doing.”
Chief Punctum: “Ha ha, it definitely does. Don’t expect me to be throwing you bones like this all of the time, Ace.”
Jade: “Don’t worry, chief, I’ve been throwing him bones this whole time.”
Chief Punctum: “Ha ha ha! Maybe we should let him do something on his own once he’s grown up a little.”
Doug: “I’m right here, you two.”
Jade: “We’re just messing with you, Doug.”
Chief Punctum: “Yeah, Ace. No need to worry.”
Doug: “Right, right.”
Doug: Probably…?  
Doug: “Thanks for everything, chief.”
