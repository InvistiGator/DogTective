Doug: When the police swarmed the scene of the crime, they found both Morgan and Goldie there.
Doug: Morgan was caught red-handed and Goldie seemed like she had no idea what was going on.
Doug: She honestly didn’t, but this fiasco was enough to launch an investigation into her company which discovered a number of shady business practices.
Doug: With more than enough evidence, Morgan was sent to jail for the murder of Norm, while Goldie was convicted for corruption and also sent to jail.
Doug: It would seem as though I inadvertently cleaned up the streets of both murderers and shady businesses.
Doug: It feels great to know that I managed to accomplish so much.
