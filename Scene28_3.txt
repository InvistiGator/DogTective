Doug: “I’m not afraid of Morgan! He’s been pushing us around and I’m tired of it.”
Jade: “Okay, Doug, if you’re sure. Let’s go have a chat with the rat.”
Doug: “How are ya doin’, Fancy Pants? Long time no see.”
Morgan: “What in the name of all that is prized are you doing here?”
Morgan: “Guards!”
Morgan: “Explain yourselves quickly, as you will be evacuated from my sight soon enough.”
Doug: “Oh, Morgan, Morgan, Morgan…”
Doug: “You just don’t get it do you?”
Doug: “You push us around, give us obviously fake evidence, and even tried to have us kicked out by your guards for doing our jobs.”
Doug: “Well no more, MISTER Evetta.”
Doug: “You are hiding something, and I will find out what it is.”
Doug: “Mark my words, Fancy Pants…”
*You grab Morgan’s collar.*
Morgan: “Ah!”
Doug: “You’re going down.”
*You and Jade get kicked out of the building.*
Jade: “Well, I hope that was satisfying, Doug, because I don’t think we’re going to be allowed anywhere near Morgan and Goldie ever again.”
Doug: “It was totally worth it.”
