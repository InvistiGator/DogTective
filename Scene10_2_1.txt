Doug: “We have to learn more about Tom. He is the shadiest person who was involved with Norm, after all.”
Doug: “I don’t trust myself to go at this whole snooping thing alone, though. I’ve never done it before…”
Doug: “So could you please do it with me, Jade?”
Doug: “Please? For the case? For me?”
Jade: “*sigh* Fine, fine… Just don’t start begging or anything.” 
Jade: “We’re going to have to be very, VERY careful, though.”
Doug: “Of course!”
Jade: “And we might have to stake out the place for a long time before we hear anything important.”
Doug: “Makes sense.”
Jade: “And If I tell you things are getting too risky, we have to leave, okay?”
Doug: “Yeah, sure!” 
Jade: “Okay, so… There’s an alleyway next to the saloon.” 
Jade: “Let’s go there, find something to hide behind, and start waiting it out.”
Doug: “Ah, two best friends sneaking around the bar of a chocolate dealer to find clues. What could be better?”
