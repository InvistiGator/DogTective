Setting: Doug’s Office
Doug: “Conducting a murder investigation isn't as easy as I thought it would be.”
Jade: “You thought it was going to be easy?”
Doug: “Maybe not easy, but at least a little more obvious, you know?”
Doug: “In murder mysteries, it always seems like the next step is the only logical one, but, in reality, there are so many options.”
Jade: “That’s just how things are, Doug.”
