Doug: I brought Tom in that day and, soon enough, I had the police swarming his secret passages for real, along with his saloon.
Doug: With that, enough evidence turned up to put Tom and most of his associates away for a very, very long time.
Doug: It’s still hard to believe, but my first big case led to me taking down one of the biggest criminals in my city.
Doug: These days, I have to be careful in certain parts of town where Tom used to have an influence, but I’d say things have been going pretty well overall.
Doug: I’ve become something of a minor celebrity due to the incident, so now I get a whole bunch of important cases from many different people.
Doug: Overall, I’d say that things have been going very well.
Doug: It feels good to be the top dog.
