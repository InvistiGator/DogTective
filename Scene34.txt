Doug: I don’t know where, but somewhere along the line I made a mistake.
Doug: I know that Goldie killed Norm - I mean, she practically admitted as much to me - but I had no way of proving it…
Doug: But does something like that stop someone like Doug Ventose?
Doug: Never.
Doug: I was able to cast enough suspicion on Goldie to have a detailed investigation done on her and her company.
Doug: They were never able to link her to Norm’s murder, but her company was not the most sound.
Doug: Now, she’s in prison not for murder, but for corrupt business practices.
Doug: It may not be much, but at least I was able to serve some justice.
Doug: I did the best that I could given what I had to work with.
