Doug: “We’ll just have to go inside and find out.”
Jade: “Sounds like a reasonable plan.”
*You enter the house*
Doug: “Goldie! What is going on here? Where did the body go?”
Goldie: “Oh, you don’t have to worry about that.”
Goldie: “Morgan came to speak to me and told me that he’s going to take good care of Norm. He’ll get a beautiful funeral and everything.”
Goldie: “He also said something about you two knowing too much.”
Doug: “Wait, what??”
Goldie: “I’m really sorry about all this.”
*Morgan’s goons jump out of a nearby room and kill you.*
*It seems that Morgan was too clever for you this time.*
*You took the bait like a good little fish.*
*Don’t be a good little fish! Be a rebel!*
*Be the most awesome fish to have ever lived.*
*Oh, and you should play again with slightly less dying.*
