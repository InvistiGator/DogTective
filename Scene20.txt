Doug: I have become the first undercover agent in history to work for Tom Confetto.
Doug: I still don’t have any single piece of evidence that I know will put Tom away for good, but I haven’t given up. I still think he was responsible for Norm’s death.
Doug: It can be pretty hard to juggle my new responsibilities working for Tom and having to constantly report back to the chief, but I’ll live.
Doug: I know I’ll catch this guy someday… I have to.
Doug: I just hope that day isn’t too far off.
