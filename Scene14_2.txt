Doug: “Hey, Jade, before we go in to speak with the chief, there’s something I wanted to tell you.”
Jade: “Sure. What’s up?”
Doug: “I think we should hold off on talking to the chief about the whole secret passage thing for now.”
Doug: “She’s been chasing Tom for years, and I don’t want to give her any information until we have investigated things further.”
Jade: “Alright, Doug. That’s fine with me.” 
Jade: “But remember that we might have to request her help once we have learned more about these passages. We’ve discovered something quite substantial.”
