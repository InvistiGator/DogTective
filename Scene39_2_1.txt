Jade: “Ah, here it is.”
Jade: “Norm’s file has lots of stuff that we already know about like his trouble in school, his penchant for exercise...”
Jade: “Oh, now this is interesting.”
Doug: “What? What is it?”
Jade: “Apparently, Doug ended up going to a private academy to take a few more classes that he needed. Maybe they were able to give him a good education there...”
Jade: “...because he was apparently scouted by Weal Law Associates and was offered a job before he was even done taking his classes.”
Doug: “Suspicious… It’s hard to imagine that he was able to turn himself around that quickly.”
Jade: “Indeed.”
Jade: “And it was apparently Morgan himself who hired Norm. How surprising.”
Jade: “Especially given that he even had issues with chocolate addiction back then, according to this.”
Doug: “So, basically, it seems like he was involved in quite a bit of shady stuff, and any of it could have gotten him killed?”
Jade: “Pretty much.”
Doug: “Well, that doesn’t narrow things down very much…”
Jade: “True, but we still managed to learn some valuable information that we can continue to use in the investigation.”
Doug: “Yeah. Let’s not get discouraged.”
