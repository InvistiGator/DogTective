Doug: Jade and I ended up helping Norm kill Tom.
Doug: Norm isn’t the smartest, but he knew a lot about Tom’s inside operation.
Doug: I had no idea that Tom had a vast system of tunnels all around the city!
Doug: They were pretty awesome to explore…
Doug: But back to the murder.
Doug: We caught Tom alone in the alleyway outside of his bar and Norm held him down while Jade and I dealt him his death of choice:
Doug: Chocolate overdose.
Doug: And we were gone as quickly as we had appeared.
Doug: Revenge was sweet but it wasn’t pretty.
Doug: I still feel bad about having done something so terrible… but I know it was for the best.
Doug: Norm was able to come out of hiding, while Jade and I continued our lives just as before.
Doug: Everything is so normal, it’s surreal…
