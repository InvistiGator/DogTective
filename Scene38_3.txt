Doug: “Let’s move on with the investigation.”
Doug: “I don’t know if I really remember all that much or if what I remember will actually be of any use.”
Doug: “Besides, we have to investigate while things are still fresh.”
Jade: “That’s fine with me.”
Jade: “If you’d like to do some more investigating while still looking into Norm’s past, we may want to go speak with Goldie.”
Doug: “Huh? Why her?”
Jade: “She owns the company that digitally records school records.”
Jade: “Remember how you could look at your report card online and all that? It was thanks to that company.”
Doug: Wow, it really seems like Goldie owns everything… 
Jade: “If we ask her nicely enough, maybe she could pull up some information about Norm.”
Doug: “Thanks for the tip, Jade.”
Doug: “Onwards!”
